Today is as normal.
And it's sleeping time gonna go to bed.
Such a tired day but worthy.
And at the end of today, i want to write something down to Michael Jackson who inspire me in music very greatful:
   Thanks Mike..(I want to call you like that,pls accept it. :))
   You're the king of pop and king of music in my heart. Your story, your music, your spirit, your familys, your cares about the world which means a loooot to this me and the world.
   I like you when you're smiling without pain. And I also wish with my heart that you can always smile like a charming boys who like making joy. That's your face in my heart which is very kind and peaceful.
   Take it easy and.. whatever you know what I about to say. Have a nice dream, sunshine.
   And last part, let me say a funny thing to you to help you keep happy and dreams like a kitty perry: You're a little bit over-confidence about girls which is very funny in a game. :) lol
   
   Love you Angels. Love you deeppply~ ‚ù§
